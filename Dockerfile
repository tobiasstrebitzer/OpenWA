# The non-root openwa user has no home of its own (`useradd -r`, no -m). Chromium resolves the home
# dir from the passwd entry via glib's getpwuid() — it IGNORES $HOME — so it tries to read/write
# /home/openwa, which does not exist. On hardened/read-only hosts that makes the browser HARD-CRASH
# at launch (SIGTRAP/int3, logged as "chrome_crashpad_handler: --database is required"). The robust
# fix is to point Chromium's config + cache at writable, pre-created dirs via XDG_* (honored directly,
# bypassing the passwd lookup); docker-entrypoint.sh creates them owned by openwa. On a read_only
# rootfs these live on the tmpfs /tmp. HOME is kept for any other HOME-relative tooling. See #254/#242.
